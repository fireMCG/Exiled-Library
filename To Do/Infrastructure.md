# Infrastructure
Let's establish the structure of the project and the content and different data types that will be included in it.

---
## Folder Structure
Should all high level categories organize their content within alphabetical sub-folders?
Should empty alphabetical sub-folders be excluded?

---
## Markdown Files
The following guide establishes a basic structure for markdown files.
[[Markdown Structure Guide]]

Let's also create guides and templates tailored for the following data and content specific markdown files:
1. ==Bosses==
2. ==Characters==
3. ==Conversations==
4. ==Dialogue==
5. ==Divination Cards==
6. ==Events==
7. ==Fragments==
8. ==Heist Targets==
9. ==Keystones==
10. ==Locations==
11. ==Lore==
12. ==Maps==
13. ==Pantheon Souls==
14. ==Prophecies==
15. ==Quest Items==
16. ==Societies==
17. ==Unique Items==
18. ==Unique Strongboxes==
### Bosses
File name should include the full name, title and honourifics as shown on the in-game health bar when facing the boss.
Should bosses only include mechanic related information and leave the lore to a separate character file?
Should all bosses also have character files?

Includes the "#Character" tag in addition to the "#Boss" tag.
### Characters
Should a separate file be made for every name variation?
Should file names only include the full name without titles and/or honourifics?
How should duplicate names be handled?
Should there be a generic file that points to character and boss variations?
