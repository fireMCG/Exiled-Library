# Prophecies
Let's first import the prophecies into the Exiled-Vault since they were official content before being removed.
1. Prophecies
	1. Prophecy name
	2. Prophecy flavour text
	3. Prophecy objective

Once that is done, let's create a table for fated unique items containing the following:
1. Fated Unique Prophecy
2. Pre-fated item name
3. Post-fated item name
4. Pre-fated item flavour text
5. Post-fated item flavour text

Should the table simply link to the pre-fated and post-fated unique items in the Exiled-Vault?
Should we include additional information?
E.g. Removal version
