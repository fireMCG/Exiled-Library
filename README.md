This repository uses the Exiled-Vault repository as a sub-module for all official GGG content related to the Path of Exile lore.
The goal of this repository is to build a library of Path of Exile lore that is easily accessible and digestible.
All of the content outside of the Exiled-Vault is manually compiled but it is all based on official sources.
