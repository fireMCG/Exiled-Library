po1 reliquary vaults (not quite "strongboxes") - apart from Voidborn Reliquary Key, each key on the following page has a link to its area, which gives the name and flavour of its chest [https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Vault_key](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Vault_key) - - the words "Relic Vault" are merely the name of the base chest (as opposed to its unique version names) - - Voidborn Reliquary has the chest Voidborn Chest with the following flavour text: Time stands still, and a new champion ascends. Twilight Order Chest (Relic Vault) (from the POE2 reliquary vault) - I think all poe2 vault keys create chests with this name and flavour: We cannot fight the gods today, nor tomorrow Take this, our children of Time, and free mankind

Two pre-fated poe1 unique items that have had their names and flavour text erased through stupid treatment of data. Their text is no longer found in the game data. Give them a special tag, like #manually_imported. Bloodboil: Rage is a big part of courage. Iron Heart: "The Council have a great many secrets. Some are better kept that way, Cospri." - Mauritius, the Iron Heart
